- CRUD and report Reviews
- Add movies to cart and then purchase
- Read the About page

Users cannot

# Logbook
## Chapters 1-3 (1 hr): https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/kkastning3_gatech_edu/IQBq-7thIWLnTpY0KNbcxbcAAeleb-scOTKPZjTGyuTHD3M?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=b5y02o
Attempted to create a venv but installed django globally instead
    Will later reorganize into django into a virtual environment per textbook recommendation
- Accidentally installed the wrong Django version, so rolled back to 5.0
- Created an about page and home page with basic HTML using Django views to render templates
- Created a base template with escape charcaters for code

## Chapter 3 Finish (thought I was recording) 
Encountered an error where Bootstrapping wasn't loading correctly into the site
- Eliminated the root cause which was HTML code with incorrect whitespace

## Chapters 4 - 6 (40 min): https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/kkastning3_gatech_edu/IQAYwiOzlxS1S6Ob3ImlUQqCAep3aMqwZbNhhCLPWQfEoOk?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=Ual17o
Created movies app and put mock data into views.py
Used Django URLs to map integers to movie pages, using it via escape and {template_data.VALUE}
Setup admin.
Refactored to use database data instead of mock data.

## Chapter 6 Finish - Chapter 9: https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/kkastning3_gatech_edu/IQB6AhQcXngeT5KWtFL2ggSaAY1twSOF1SE2vapPfb5-IlU?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=Ah9UdB
Created new accounts app.
Created a new signup page with error handling/displaying.
- displays signup on GET request, else on form POST it redirects 
Setup full auth with login, logout, and conditional navbar rendering

Tried to fix bug where adding review doesn't work
- fixed by remedying another whitespace issue
Added edit review function
- if GET returns rendered edit_review page, else POST it updates it by getting the object
- note: adding to urls.py is for exposing/creating urls to html files.
- utilize url id addressing to pass values
Added delete review
Created a cart app
- add to cart, index page, clear function
Created Order and Item models
- made it so user can see their orders (accounts)
- can now purchase items via the cart
Styling seemed a bit off for the footer.
- To fix, I wrapped base.html in a flexbox
Added Report option for Reviews with view conditions based on if reported already or if a user is the user who made the review.
- forgot to add a single line of review.save that I added off camera (was just looking through and didn't think I'd have to make changes)
Uploaded and hosted on PythonAnywhere.
